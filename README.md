# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analyis was to condense a list of table points into a format for analysis in our case seeing the outcome of project. We compared success rates and picked which we wanted to compare to gage an understanding of what projects were successful or not.

### Purpose
To see what in the KickStarter campagin project was successful, failed, or canceled.

## Analysis and Challenges
Creating the data and putting raw data in a particular format that looks at one element helps clean up analysis to make it less overwhelming. This helps us pick and choose what specific points we want to analyze. I struggled mainly with the start of the challenge which was converting the date and searching in categories. I overcame this by referencing the solved version, using google, and watching youtube videos to help me piece together what I was struggling with. I first created a filter on the data like counting number of successful outcomes in january into a pivot table then I put them into a line graphs with the other points. I grabbed the data while I was formatting my data series.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The summer months tend to be more successful with launch dates.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The two extremes of the chart were shown to be successful. Those projects that had less money and the most money spent were the most successsful. In the middle rangesd it did not matter as much.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1.Summer months are the most successful to launch.
2. Failed projects tend to stay consistent throughout the year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Most successful projects were under $1000

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
It is hard to combine outcome on goals and launch date together because they are two seperate pieces of information.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A bar graph or pie chart since it would show either a part of a whole or quantify data seperatly each month.
